# Working With CNN:
## Introduction Of CNN
### •	A Convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network.
### •	In Neural Network one of the main category to do image classification, object detection and segmentation etc.. are some of the areas where  CNN are widely used.

## Before understand Convolutional neural network first take the look of image.
### What is meant by Image:-Image is a collection of pixel as well as 2D representation of real word object is called as image.

### Types Of Image

### There are two type Of Images.
#### 1.	Gray Scale Image:

*	In Gray scale image only one channel is present
* The range of pixel in gray scale image is 0 to 255. where 0 represent to black and 255 represent to white.

#### 2.	RGB Scale Image:

* In RGB Image three channel is present red, green and blue.
* The range of pixel in RGB image is 0 to 255, where 0 represent the black and 255 represent the red, green and blue.
